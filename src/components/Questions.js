      minimum speeds of 0.5 Mbps for video and 3 Mbps for high resolution is

      typically have students take a placement test to assess their current
      proficiency and assign them to an appropriate group. What learning

      supplementary materials and resources during the online classes.
      Administrative FAQs How do I change teachers if needed? Most schools allow

      arrangements. What is the cancellation/refund policy? Schools have
      specific terms and conditions regarding cancellations, rescheduling, and
